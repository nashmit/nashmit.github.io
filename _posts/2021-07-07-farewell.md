"I suppose, in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go. But what always hurts the most... is not taking a moment to say goodbye."

But for every moment of cruel lucidity another childish craziness one is resurrected: "Pour gagner à ce jeu, il faut une jolie boîte, une jolie copine... Le reste, on s'en fout."

It's like hope is hidden in every nonsense scattered that you discover randomly by the time it hits you with a magnitude that it's ready to create a chaos around you... you have no idea who you are and where you're going; they keep coming, giving meaning once more to Roman god Janus, with an eye in the past and another in the future; a good side and a bad side in every person... but with no answers and no direction for your future... letting you move with an unknown velocity to your new nonsense, because you have no idea what to do next or maybe because you don't find any reason in doing something to begin with; how could you know in the first place? how would you choose between multiple nonsenses when you have no idea what they may be hidden under... what hope may bring every time...
